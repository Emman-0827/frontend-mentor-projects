## My process

### Built with

- Semantic HTML5 markup
- CSS custom properties

### What I learned

i learned how to work with margin, padding and how to create responsive web design using media queries.

To see how you can add code snippets, see below:

```html
<h1>Some HTML code I'm proud of</h1>
```

```css
.proud-of-this-css {
  color: papayawhip;
}
```

### Continued development

i would like to learn more on how to create responsive websites.
i would like to continue learning more on how to work with CSS media queries and and positioning element on the webpage

### Useful resources

.

- [Example resource 2](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/) - The MDN network is a great site for it provids good articles about the web which helped me to finally understand HTML and CSS. I'd recommend it to anyone still learning this concept.
